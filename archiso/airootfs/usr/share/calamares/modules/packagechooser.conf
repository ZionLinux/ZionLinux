# Configuration for the low-density software chooser
---
# Software selection mode, to set whether the software packages
# can be chosen singly, or multiply.
#
# Possible modes are "optional", "required" (for zero-or-one or exactly-one)
# or "optionalmultiple", "requiredmultiple" (for zero-or-more
# or one-or-more).
mode: required

# Software installation method:
#
# - "legacy" or "custom" or "contextualprocess"
#   When set to "legacy", writes a GlobalStorage value for the choice that
#   has been made. The key is *packagechooser_<id>*. The module's
#   instance name is used; see the *instances* section of `settings.conf`.
#   If there is just one packagechooser module, and no special instance is set,
#   resulting GS key is probably *packagechooser_packagechooser*.
#
#   The GS value is a comma-separated list of the IDs of the selected
#   packages, or an empty string if none is selected.
#
#   With "legacy" installation, you should have a contextualprocess or similar
#   module somewhere in the `exec` phase to process the GlobalStorage key
#   and actually **do** something for the packages.
#
# - "packages"
#   When set to "packages", writes GlobalStorage values suitable for
#   consumption by the *packages* module (which should appear later
#   in the `exec` section. These package settings will then be handed
#   off to whatever package manager is configured there.
#
# There is no need to put this module in the `exec` section. There
# are no jobs that this module provides. You should put **other**
# modules, either *contextualprocess* or *packages* or some custom
# module, in the `exec` section to do the actual work.
method: legacy


# Human-visible strings in this module. These are all optional.
# The following translated keys are used:
#  - *step*, used in the overall progress view (left-hand pane)
#
# Each key can have a [locale] added to it, which is used as
# the translated string for that locale. For the strings
# associated with the "no-selection" item, see *items*, below
# with the explicit item-*id* "".
#
labels:
    step: "Packages"
    
# (Optional) item-*id* of pre-selected list-view item.
# Pre-selects one of the items below.
# default: kde

# Items to display in the chooser. In general, this should be a
# pretty short list to avoid overwhelming the UI. This is a list
# of objects, and the items are displayed in list order.
#
# Either provide the data for an item in the list (using the keys
# below), or use existing AppData XML files, or use AppStream cache
# as a source for the data.
#
# For data provided by the list: the item has an id, which is used in
# setting the value of *packagechooser_<module-id>*. The following field
# is mandatory:
#
#  - *id*
#       ID for the product. The ID "" is special, and is used for
#       "no package selected". Only include this if the mode allows
#       selecting none. The name and description given for the "no package
#       selected" item are displayed when the module starts.
#
# Each item must adhere to one of three "styles" of item. Which styles
# are supported depends on compile-time dependencies of Calamares.
# Both AppData and AppStream may **optionally** be available.
#
# # Generic Items #
#
# These items are always supported. They require the most configuration
# **in this file** and duplicate information that may be available elsewhere
# (e.g. in AppData or AppStream), but do not require any additional
# dependencies. These items have the following **mandatory** fields:
#
#  - *name*
#       Human-readable name of the product. To provide translations,
#       add a *[lang]* decoration as part of the key name, e.g. `name[nl]`
#       for Dutch. The list of usable languages can be found in
#       `CMakeLists.txt` or as part of the debug output of Calamares.
#  - *description*
#       Human-readable description. These can be translated as well.
#  - *screenshot*
#       Path to a single screenshot of the product. May be a filesystem
#       path or a QRC path, e.g. ":/images/no-selection.png". If the path
#       is not found (e.g. is a non-existent absolute path, or is a relative
#       path that does not exist in the current working directory) then
#       an additional attempt is made to load the image from the **branding**
#       directory.
#
# The following field is **optional** for an item:
#
#  - *packages* :
#       List of package names for the product. If using the *method*
#       "packages", consider this item mandatory (because otherwise
#       selecting the item would install no packages).
#
items:
    - id: ""
      # packages: [] # This item installs no packages
      name: "No Desktop"
      description: "Please pick a desktop environment from the list. If you don't, you will boot up in a terminal, being able to install a desktop environment from there."
