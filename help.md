# Zion Linux support.
 We have multiple sources where you can get support/help with Zion.
 
 The most active is probably our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/e4XaX6zcBa).
 
 You can also get support on the [Issues](https://github.com/zionlinux/zionlinux/issues) tab. (May be slower.)
 
 Other sources will be added soon.
 
 
 **Whilst that is in process**, keep in mind Zion is still in heavy development.
 
 Only by one person, currently.
