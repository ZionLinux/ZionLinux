# Zion Linux.
Made by developers, for developers.


Based on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org).

Other **Repositories** can be found at the bottom of the ``readme``.

# Download

Currently, there will be **no download** until the installer, Calamares is fully working.

If you want to build the current ISO, follow the building instructions.

If you want to help the project, open a pull request or join the discord server and DM me.


Currently I won't make the discord server public as of the rebranding of **THE Linux to Zion Linux.**

# Building

to build the ISO, follow these steps:

``git clone https://github.com/zionlinux/zionlinux``

Then do:

```
cd zionlinux
cd installation-stuff
./build-iso.sh
# Type in 1 and press enter.
# Then wait.
```

the iso can be found in the ``archiso`` directory at the root of the filesystem.
