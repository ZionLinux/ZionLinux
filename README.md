# Zion Linux.
Made by developers, for developers.

<br>

Based on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org). <br>
Other **Repositories** can be found at the bottom of the ``readme``.

# Download

~~Currently, there will be **no download** until the installer, Calamares is fully working.~~

Calamares is fully working, so as I promised. Here's the download: [Releases Tab](https://github.com/zionlinux/zionlinux/releases)



# Contributing

If you want to help the project, open a pull request or join the discord server and DM me.
But, currently I won't link the discord server for other reasons.

# Building

to build the ISO, first you need to have a copy of [this Repository](https://github.com/zionlinux/zionlinux) to your machine. <br>
To do that, you will need to ``git clone`` this Repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/zionlinux/zionlinux
```

You will need to cd to ``installation-stuff`` where the build script is located.

```
cd zionlinux
cd archiso
```
Then, run the script and select option **one**.

```
./build.sh
# Grab a cup of tea, this is gonna take a while.
```

the output can be found in the ``archiso`` directory at the root of the filesystem.
