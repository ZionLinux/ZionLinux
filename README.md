# Zion Linux.
Made by developers, for developers.


Based on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org).

Other **Repositories** can be found at the bottom of the ``readme``.

# Building


To build the iso, you will first need the latest version of the custom Calamares config for Zion. Which will be pushed later.

For now, to only build the ISO, follow these steps:

``git clone https://github.com/zionlinux/zionlinux``

Then do:

```
cd zionlinux
cd installation-stuff
./build-iso.sh
# Type in 1 and press enter.
# Then wait.
```
