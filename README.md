# Zion Linux.
Made by developers, for developers.

<br>

Based on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org). <br>
Other **Repositories** can be found at the bottom of the ``readme``.

# Download

Currently, there will be **no download** until the installer, Calamares is fully working. <br>
If you want to build the current ISO, follow the building instructions. <br>
If you want to help the project, open a pull request or join the discord server and DM me. <br>
<br>
Currently I won't make the discord server public as of the rebranding of **THE Linux to Zion Linux.**

# Building

to build the ISO, first you need to have a copy of [this Repository](https://github.com/zionlinux/zionlinux) to your machine. <br>
To do that, you will need to ``git clone`` this Repository.

```git clone https://github.com/zionlinux/zionlinux```

You will need to cd to ``installation-stuff`` where the build script is located.

```
cd zionlinux
cd installation-stuff
```
Then, run the script and select option **one**.

```
./build-iso.sh
# Type in 1 and press enter.
# Then wait.
```

the output can be found in the ``archiso`` directory at the root of the filesystem.
